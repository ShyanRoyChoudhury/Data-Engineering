# Real-time-stock-market-emulation-using-kafka
In this very exciting project, I have created a model to emulate a toned down version of realtime stock market scenario using kafka. Where data is constanly being generated from the stock prices and updated on the database. I have used a pre-recorded dataset to sample data from it and the generated data is constantly being  uploaded to AWS glue database.
